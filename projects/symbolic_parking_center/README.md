# 🚗 Symbolic Parking Center

A modular symbolic interface for guiding urban drivers using intelligent systems, drones, and personalized behavior tracking.

This project is part of the **Urban Symbolic City** initiative, blending AI-driven feedback with spatial design and user-specific insights to reshape the parking experience.

### 🔍 Core Features:
- Symbolic behavior tracking based on user mobility and contextual interaction
- Drone-guided routing for low-traffic streets with responsive detection and rewards
- Dynamic parking score generation tied to vehicle behavior and location history
- Visual memory recovery: recalls previous visits, scene observations, or routing decisions
- AI-based interaction with user vehicle states before and after each trip

### 🧠 Planned Modules:
- Image-sharing interface from drone journeys
- Public repository of symbolic street visuals, reviewed by specialists
- Reward system linked to a symbolic parking center
- Free drone assistance for confused or lost vehicles with location-based pathing
